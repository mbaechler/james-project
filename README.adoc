== How to try James

Requirements: docker & docker-compose installed.

When you try James this way, you will use the most current state of James.
It will be configured to run with Cassandra & ElasticSearch.
All those three components will be started with a single command.

You can retrieve the docker-compose file :

    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/james-project/master/dockerfiles/run/docker-compose.yml

Then, you just have to start the services:

    $ docker-compose up

Wait a few seconds in order to have all those services start up. You will see the following log when James is available:
james           | Started : true

A default domain, james.local, has been created. You can see this by running:

    $ docker exec james java -jar /root/james-cli.jar -h 127.0.0.1 -p 9999 listdomains

James will respond to IMAP port 143 and SMTP port 25.
You have to create users before playing with james. You may also want to create other domains.
Follow the 'Useful commands' section for more information about James CLI.


== How to build and publish the website

 1. Install Apache Maven 3.0.2+ and make its binary 'mvn' available on your PATH.
    See http://maven.apache.org/download.html#Installation.
 2. run "mvn clean site"
 3. Test the built site in your browser from the {path}/target/site folder
 4. If everything looks OK, deploy the site using "mvn clean site-deploy".
 5. Wait for the changes to replicate to the Apache web server or setup 140.211.11.10:80 as
    a proxy to review the changes (described here: http://www.apache.org/dev/project-site.html)

To deploy the technical reports use the "-Psite-reports" profile.

For wagon-ssh-external configuration see
http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-deploy-plugin/examples/deploy-ssh-external.html

You can alternatively use a docker container to build the website :

You need to build the homepage by:

    $ docker build -t james/homepage dockerfiles/site/homepage
    $ docker run -v $PWD:/origin -v $PWD/site:/destination james/homepage master

In order to test the homepage, you can use this command:

    $ docker run --rm -v $PWD/site:/srv/jekyll  -p 4000:4000 -it jekyll/minimal:3.8.3 jekyll serve

the site will be available at http://localhost:4000/

Then you build the other pages by:

    $ docker build -t james/site dockerfiles/site/website
    $ docker run -v $PWD/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $PWD:/origin -v $PWD/site:/destination james/site master

If you need to update the current site, checkout the branch asf-site from Apache git:

    $ git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/james-site.git
    $ cd james-site
    $ git checkout origin/asf-site -b asf-site

And replace in the previous commands `$PWD/site` by `<james-site-clone-directory>/content`, for example:

    $ docker run -v $PWD:/origin -v $PWD/../james-site/content:/destination james/homepage master
    $ docker run -v $PWD/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $PWD/../james-site/content:/origin -v $PWD/site:/destination james/site master

Then just push the new site:

    $ cd ../james-site
    $ git push origin asf-site

== How to release via maven release plugin

See details on http://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html

In short, just follow the 'standard' process:

* Prepare pom for release
* publish snapshot
* prepare release
* stage the release for a vote (don't forget to close the staging repository)
* vote
* release

Don't forget to add your key to http://www.apache.org/dist/james/KEYS

    $ ssh people.apache.org
    $ cd /www/www.apache.org/dist/james


== How to compile

Build related tasks are all implemented with Docker to minimize environment related failures.
We use a multi-stage build to allow reuse between various targets.

For compilation, run:

    $ DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --progress plain --target builder -f dockerfiles/Dockerfile .

== How to run the testsuite

The testsuite is no executed by default because it's really long and resource intensive.
To run it, you need to run:

    $ DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --progress plain --target run-tests -f dockerfiles/Dockerfile .

Some tests needs a DOCKER_HOST environment variable in order to be played, they will be ignored if you don't provide this variable.
If you wish to play them, you may add this arguments to previous command (depending on your docker configuration):

    --env DOCKER_HOST=tcp://172.17.0.1:2376

If you are using a a fresh installation of Docker, your DOCKER_HOST should be unix:///var/run/docker.sock and you should mount this socket as a volume:

    --env DOCKER_HOST=unix:///var/run/docker.sock -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock

== How to run James in Docker

There are a number of different images available:

 * Single-node James with Guice for testing purpose only (Derby/Lucene)
 * Single-node SMTP-only James with Guice for testing purpose only (Derby/Lucene)
 * Single-node SMTP-only James with Guice for MariaDB (MariaDB/Lucene)
 * Distributed James with Guice (Cassandra/ElasticSearch/RabbitMQ/Swift)
 * Distributed James with Guice + ldap support (Cassandra/ElasticSearch/RabbitMQ/Swift)
 * Transitional almost-distributed James with Guice (Cassandra/ElasticSearch)
 * Transitional almost-distributed James with Guice + ldap support (Cassandra/ElasticSearch)
 * Flexible distribution of James with Spring

=== Run single-node James with Guice for testing purpose only (Derby/Lucene)

You need to generate the docker image you want to use. For this image, you have to run
the following command:

    $ DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --progress plain --tag jpa-guice --target jpa-guice -f dockerfiles/Dockerfile .

Once the image is built, you need to mount a configuration directory to `/root/conf`, you can use the default
configurations from `configurations/jpa`.

However, you need to provide the key that will be used for TLS. For obvious reasons, this is not provided in the
default configuration directory.

Copy your TLS keys and modify configuration files accordingly or generate it using the following command.
 The password must be `james72laBalle` to match default configuration.

    $ keytool -genkey -alias james -keyalg RSA -keystore configurations/jpa/keystore

Finally, you can start the server by running:

    $ docker run --hostname HOSTNAME -v $PWD/configurations/jpa:/root/conf -p "25:25" -p 80:80 \
    -p "110:110" -p "143:143" -p "465:465" -p "587:587" -p "993:993" -p 143:143 jpa-guice

Where :

- HOSTNAME: is the hostname you want to give to your James container. This DNS entry will be used to send mail to your James server.


=== Run Single-node SMTP-only James with Guice for testing purpose only (Derby/Lucene)

You need to generate the docker image you want to use. For this image, you have to run
the following command:

    $ DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --progress plain --tag jpa-smtp --target jpa-smtp -f dockerfiles/Dockerfile .

Once the image is built, you need to mount a configuration directory to `/root/conf`, you can use the default
configurations from `configurations/jpa-smtp`.

However, you need to provide the key that will be used for TLS. For obvious reasons, this is not provided in the
default configuration directory.

Copy your TLS keys and modify configuration files accordingly or generate it using the following command.
 The password must be `james72laBalle` to match default configuration.

    $ keytool -genkey -alias james -keyalg RSA -keystore configurations/jpa-smtp/keystore

Finally, you can start the server by running:

    $ docker run --hostname HOSTNAME -v $PWD/configurations/jpa-smtp:/root/conf -p "25:25" -p 80:80 \
    -p "465:465" -p "587:587" jpa-guice

Where :

- HOSTNAME: is the hostname you want to give to your James container. This DNS entry will be used to send mail to your James server.


=== Run Single-node SMTP-only James with Guice for MariaDB (MariaDB/Lucene)

You need to generate the docker image you want to use. For this image, you have to run
the following command:

    $ DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --progress plain --tag jpa-smtp-mariadb --target jpa-smtp-mariadb-guice -f dockerfiles/Dockerfile .

Once the image is built, you need to mount a configuration directory to `/root/conf`, you can use the default
configurations from `configurations/jpa-smtp`.

However, you need to provide the key that will be used for TLS. For obvious reasons, this is not provided in the
default configuration directory.

Copy your TLS keys and modify configuration files accordingly or generate it using the following command.
 The password must be `james72laBalle` to match default configuration.

    $ keytool -genkey -alias james -keyalg RSA -keystore configurations/jpa-smtp/keystore

Finally, you can start the server by running:

    $ docker run --hostname HOSTNAME -v $PWD/configurations/jpa-smtp:/root/conf -p "25:25" -p 80:80 \
    -p "465:465" -p "587:587" jpa-smtp-mariadb-guice

Where :

- HOSTNAME: is the hostname you want to give to your James container. This DNS entry will be used to send mail to your James server.


=== Run distributed James with Guice (Cassandra/ElasticSearch/RabbitMQ/Swift)

==== Start dependencies

You need a running *cassandra* in docker. To achieve this run:

    $ docker run -d --name=cassandra cassandra:3.11.3

You need a running *rabbitmq* in docker. To achieve this run:

    $ docker run -d --name=rabbitmq rabbitmq:3.7.7-management

You need a running *swift* objectstorage in docker. To achieve this run:

    $ docker run -d --name=swift linagora/openstack-keystone-swift:pike

You need a running *ElasticSearch* in docker. To achieve this run:

    $ docker run -d --name=elasticsearch elasticsearch:2.4.6

If you want to use all the JMAP search capabilities, you may also need to start Tika:

    $ docker run -d --name=tika logicalspark/docker-tikaserver:1.20

You can find more explanation on the need of Tika in this page http://james.apache.org/server/config-elasticsearch.html

==== Running James

You need to generate the docker image you want to use. For this image, you have to run
the following command:

    $ DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --progress plain --tag cassandra-rabbitmq --target cassandra-rabbitmq-guice -f dockerfiles/Dockerfile .

Once the image is built, you need to mount a configuration directory to `/root/conf`, you can use the default
configurations from `configurations/cassandra-rabbitmq`.

However, you need to provide the key that will be used for TLS. For obvious reasons, this is not provided in the
default configuration directory.

Copy your TLS keys and modify configuration files accordingly or generate it using the following command.
 The password must be `james72laBalle` to match default configuration.

    $ keytool -genkey -alias james -keyalg RSA -keystore configurations/cassandra-rabbitmq/keystore

Finally, you can start the server by running:

    $ docker run --hostname HOSTNAME -p "25:25" -p 80:80 -p "110:110" -p "143:143" -p "465:465" -p "587:587" -p "993:993" \
    --link cassandra:cassandra --link rabbitmq:rabbitmq --link elasticsearch:elasticsearch --link tika:tika \
    --link swift:swift -v $PWD/configurations/cassandra-rabbitmq:/root/conf cassandra-rabbitmq

Where :

- HOSTNAME: is the hostname you want to give to your James container. This DNS entry will be used to send mail to your James server.

You can add an optional port binding to port 8000, to expose the webadmin server. Please note that users are not
authenticated on webadmin server, thus you should avoid exposing it in production.

If you want to pass additional options to the underlying java command, you can configure a _JVM_OPTIONS_ env variable, for example add:

    --env JVM_OPTIONS="-Xms256m -Xmx2048m"

To have log file accessible on a volume, add *-v  $PWD/logs:/logs* option to the above command line, where *$PWD/logs* is your local directory to put files in.

==== Handling attachment indexing

You can handle attachment text extraction before indexing in ElasticSearch. This makes attachments searchable. To enable this:

Run tika:

    $ docker run --name tika logicalspark/docker-tikaserver:1.20

Add a link for the tika container in the above command line:

    $ docker run --hostname HOSTNAME -p "25:25" -p 80:80 -p "110:110" -p "143:143" -p "465:465" -p "587:587" -p "993:993" --link cassandra:cassandra --link rabbitmq:rabbitmq
    --link elasticsearch:elasticsearch --link tika:tika --name james_run -t james_run


=== Run James with Java 8 + Spring + JPA

==== Requirements

Built artifacts should be in ./dockerfiles/run/spring/destination folder for Spring.
If you haven't already:

    $ docker build -t james/project dockerfiles/compilation/java-8
    $ docker run -v $HOME/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $PWD:/origin \
  -v $PWD/dockerfiles/run/spring/destination:/spring/destination \
  -t james/project -s HEAD


==== Howto ?

We need to provide the key we will use for TLS. For obvious reasons, this is not provided in this git.

Copy your TSL keys to destination/run/spring/conf/keystore or generate it using the following command. The password must be james72laBalle to match default configuration.

    $ keytool -genkey -alias james -keyalg RSA -keystore dockerfiles/run/spring/destination/conf/keystore

Then we need to build james container :

    $ docker build -t james_run dockerfiles/run/spring/

The provisioned james images bases on pre-build james server which is "linagora/james-project-spring-jpa". If we need to build james container with the default initial data (initial domain: james.local and initial users: user01, user02, user03):

    $ docker build -t james_run dockerfiles/run/spring/provisioned/

To run this container :

    $ docker run --hostname HOSTNAME -p "25:25" -p "110:110" -p "143:143" -p "465:465" -p "587:587" -p "993:993" --name james_run -t james_run

Where HOSTNAME is the hostname you want to give to your James container. This DNS entry will be used to send mail to your James server.


== Other Useful commands

The base command is different whether you choose guice flavor or spring :

  * guice use : `docker exec james_run java -jar /root/james-cli.jar`
  * spring use : `docker exec james_run /root/james-server-app-3.0.0-beta6-SNAPSHOT/bin/james-cli.sh`

=== How to add a domain ?

    # Add DOMAIN to 127.0.0.1 in your host /etc/hosts
    $ <your-command-here> -h 127.0.0.1 -p 9999 adddomain DOMAIN

DOMAIN: is the domain you want to add.

Note: Using docker, one can add an environment variable holding the domain to be created. This
domain will be created upon James start:

    $ --environment DOMAIN=domain.tld

=== How to add a user ?

    $ <your-command-here> -h 127.0.0.1 -p 9999 adduser USER_MAIL_ADDRESS PASSWORD

Where :

* USER_MAIL_ADDRESS: is the mail address that will be used by this user.
* PASSWORD: is the password that will be used by this user.

You can then just add DOMAIN to your /etc/hosts and you can connect to your james account with for instance Thunderbird.

=== How to manage SIEVE scripts ?

Each user can manage his SIEVE scripts threw the manage SIEVE mailet.

To use the manage SIEVE mailet :

 * You need to create the user sievemanager@DOMAIN ( if you don't, the SMTP server will check the domain, recognize it, and look for an absent local user, and will generate an error ).
 * You can send Manage Sieve commands by mail to sievemanager@DOMAIN. Your subject must contain the command. Scripts needs to be added as attachments and need the ".sieve" extension.

To activate a script for a user, you need the following combinaison :

 * PUTSCRIPT scriptname
 * SETACTIVE scriptname

=== How to retrieve users and password from my previous container

Some james data (those non related to mailbox, eg : mail queue, domains, users, rrt, SIEVE scripts, mail repositories ) are not yet supported by our Cassandra implementation.

To keep these data when you run a new container, you can mount the following volume :

 -v /root/james-server-app-3.0.0-beta6-SNAPSHOT/var:WORKDIR/destination/var

Where :

* WORKDIR: is the absolute path to your james-parent workdir.

Beware : you will have concurrency issues if multiple containers are running on this single volume.

=== How to run deployment Tests

We wrote some MPT (James' Mail Protocols Tests subproject) deployment tests to validate a James
deployment.

It uses the External-James module, that uses environment variables to locate a remote
IMAP server and run integration tests against it.

For that, the target James Server needs to be configured with a domain domain and a user imapuser
with password password. Read above documentation to see how you can do this.

You have to run MPT tests inside docker. As you need to use maven, the simplest option is to
use james/parent image, and override the entry point ( as git and maven are already configured
there ) :

    $ docker run -t --entrypoint="/root/integration_tests.sh" -v $PWD/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $PWD:/origin james/project JAMES_IP JAMES_PORT SHA1

Where :

* JAMES_IP: IP address or DNS entry for your James server
* JAMES_PORT: Port allocated to James' IMAP port (should be 143).
* SHA1(optional): Branch to use in order to build integration tests or master if none.

=== How to check the merge of a commit

First step, you have to build the Docker image

    $ docker build -t james/merge dockerfiles/merge

In order to run the build, you have to launch the following command:

    $ docker run -v $PWD:/origin -t james/merge SHA1 RESULTING_BRANCH

Where :

- SHA1: is the given git SHA1 of the james-project repository to merge.
- RESULTING_BRANCH: is the branch created when merging.

== Generating a package for James

You can generate a deb package and an RPM package for James by using the following process.

First step, you have to build the Docker image used to generate the package

    $ docker build -t build-james-packages \
        --build-arg RELEASE=3.2.0 \
        --build-arg ITERATION=1 \
        --build-arg BASE=linagora/james-project \
        --build-arg BASE_LDAP=linagora/james-ldap-project \
        --build-arg BASE_RABBITMQ=linagora/james-rabbitmq-project \
        --build-arg TAG=latest \
        dockerfiles/packaging/guice/cassandra

Where:

- ITERATION is the release number used after the last hyphen (e.g. 3.0.1, 3.1.0, 3.2.0...)
- BASE is the image jar and executable are copied from. Defaults to linagora/james-project
- BASE_LDAP is the image jar and executable are copied from for a deployment with an LDAP user repository. Defaults to linagora/james-ldap-project
- BASE_RABBITMQ is the image jar and executable are copied from for a deployment of linagora/james-project + RabbitMQ + Swift BlobStore.
Defaults to linagora/james-rabbitmq-project
- TAG is the tag of these docker images. Defaults to latest.

Then, you have to run the container:

    $ docker run --name james-packages -v $PWD/result:/result build-james-packages

Where:

- $PWD/result is the folder where the deb and the RPM packages will be copied

Note: A helper script is provided for the generation of packages for a specific git commit. For instance:

    $ sh dockerfiles/packaging/guice/cassandra/package.sh 3.2.0 1 c298195e84 $PWD/result

The generated package allow you to choose between a deployment with or without LDAP using update-alternatives.
Once installed, try:

    $ update-alternatives --config james

By default James is configured without LDAP support.
