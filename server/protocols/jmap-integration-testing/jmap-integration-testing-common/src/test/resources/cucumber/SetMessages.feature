    And a user "alice@domain.tld"
    And a user "bob@domain.tld"
    And "bob@domain.tld" has a mailbox "shared"
    And "alice@domain.tld" has a mailbox "INBOX"
    And "bob@domain.tld" has a message "mBob" in "shared" mailbox with two attachments in text
    And "alice@domain.tld" has a message "mAlice" in "INBOX" mailbox with two attachments in text
