Feature: Download endpoint
  As a James user
  I want to access to the download endpoint

  Background:
    Given a domain named "domain.tld"
    And some users "usera@domain.tld", "userb@domain.tld", "userc@domain.tld"
    And "usera@domain.tld" has a mailbox "INBOX"
    And "usera@domain.tld" mailbox "INBOX" contains a message "m1" with an attachment "a1"
    
  Scenario: An authenticated user should initiate the access to the download endpoint
    Given "usera@domain.tld" is connected
    When "usera@domain.tld" checks for the availability of the attachment endpoint
    Then the user should be authorized

  Scenario: An unauthenticated user should initiate the access to the download endpoint
    When "usera@domain.tld" checks for the availability of the attachment endpoint
    Then the user should be authorized

  Scenario: An authenticated user should have access to the download endpoint
    Given "usera@domain.tld" is connected
    When "usera@domain.tld" downloads "a1"
    Then the user should be authorized

  @Ignore
  Scenario: An unauthenticated user should not have access to the download endpoint
    When "usera@domain.tld" downloads "a1"
    Then the user should not be authorized

  Scenario: A authenticated user should not have access to the download endpoint without a blobId
    Given "usera@domain.tld" is connected
    When "usera@domain.tld" asks for an attachment without blobId parameter
    Then the user should receive a bad request response


  Scenario: A user should not retrieve anything when using wrong blobId
    Given "usera@domain.tld" is connected
    When "usera@domain.tld" asks for an attachment with wrong blobId
    Then the user should receive a not found response

  @Ignore
  Scenario: A user should not have access to someone else attachment
    Given "userb@domain.tld" is connected
    When "userb@domain.tld" downloads "a1"
    Then the user should receive a not found response

  @Ignore
  Scenario: A user should not have access to someone else attachment
    Given "usera@domain.tld" shares its mailbox "INBOX" with "userb@domain.tld"
    And "userb@domain.tld" is connected
    When "userb@domain.tld" downloads "a1"
    Then the user should be authorized
